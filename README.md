# RUAlertbot
## Twilio branch
Attempt to implement Twilio

## Goals
- ~~Have RUAlerts sent to Twilio number~~
- ~~Remove dependancy on gmail inbox scanning~~
- ~~Forward alerts from Twilio number to myself so I can receive alerts too~~
- Set up public webserver with static IP

#####Notes
My testing subreddit is /r/BraveHorizon, so some scrpts might show attempts to post there instead of /r/Rutgers. It's a private subreddit so test posts don't show up in /u/RU_Alert_Bot's history.
